README file for swig_fault.

This directory contains an example of a C++ libary being called by
python. The interface between the two languages is generated by SWIG.
The purpose of the code is to demonstrate how C++ exceptions are
caught by python.

The code is build with scons version v0.97.  After installing scons,
just type scons to build in each directory.  Cleaning the directory
can be done with scons -c.  Scons ignores the user's $PATH variable,
so in some cases the path to swig will need to be specified in
buildOpts.py.  The original version of buildOpts.py has the swig path
commented out.  The command scons -h will display the path to swig
that scons is using.

This code was developed using SWIG version 1.3.33.  The GNU cpp
versions were 4.0.1 on an intel mac and 4.1.2 on an intel CentOS linux
box.  The python version was 2.5.1.
