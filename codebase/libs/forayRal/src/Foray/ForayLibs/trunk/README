ForayLibs

Author: Dennis Flanigan, dennisf@ucar.edu.

Foray is a set of C++ classes to read and write remotely
sensed scientific data collected in spherical coordinates.
Right now foray only works with ground based meteorological radars.

SCons is required to build:
	http://www.scons.org

Foray is dependent on the netCDF library from unidata:
	http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf



Build Options:
-------------
The ForayLibs build scripts accepts two options: ncdir and prefix.
ncdir specifies the root directory path where the netcdf library was
installed.  prefix specifies the root location where foray libraries
will be installed.  The command:

     scons -h

will print out the default and current values of ncdir and prefix.

Both of these options can be set from the command line.  This example
sets ncdir to /usr/local
  
     scons ncdir=/usr/local


Options can also be set in file named buildOpts.py.  This options files is 
a python script.  Setting ncdir in buildOpts.py would look like this:

     ncdir='/usr/local'


If the buildOpts.py file does not exist, the build scripts will create
one containing the options that override the defaults values.  


Install Target:
--------------
Use the install target to install the foray libraries in the root library
specified by the prefix option:

     scons install prefix=/usr/local/foray

This will install foray include files in:


     /usr/local/foray/include

and library files in:

     /usr/local/foray/lib
