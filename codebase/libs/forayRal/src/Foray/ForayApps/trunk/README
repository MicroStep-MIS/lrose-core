ForayApps

Author: Dennis Flanigan, dennisf@ucar.edu.

Foray Apps are set of example applications that use
the Foray libraries.


SCons is required to build:
	http://www.scons.org

Foray is dependent on the netCDF library from unidata:
	http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf



Build Options:
The ForayLibs build scripts accepts three options: ncdir,foraydir and prefix.
ncdir specifies the root directory path where the netcdf library was
installed.  foraydir specifies the root location where foray libraries
will be installed. prefix defines the root location where foray apps will
be installed  The command:

     scons -h

will print out the default and current values of the options.

These options can be set from the command line.  This example
sets ncdir to /usr/local
  
     scons ncdir=/usr/local


Options can also be set in file named buildOpts.py.  This options files is 
a python script.  Setting ncdir in buildOpts.py would look like this:

     ncdir='/usr/local'


If the buildOpts.py file does not exist, the build scripts will create
one containing the options that override the defaults values.  

Install Target:
--------------
Use the install target to install the foray libraries in the root library
specified by the prefix option:

     scons install prefix=/usr/local/foray

This will install foray applications in

     /usr/local/foray/bin
