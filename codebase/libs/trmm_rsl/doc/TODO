Work To Do (some WTD's are from previous WTD's):

1. Add RHI processing.  Or, at least, debug why it doesn't work now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
No additional functionality is planed for RSL.  The following will occur
as a consequence of TRMM GV production:

o Bug fixes.

o Optimizations.

o Documentation updates.
