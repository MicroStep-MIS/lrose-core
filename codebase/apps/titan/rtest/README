RUNNING REAL-TIME TITAN TEST - RTEST
====================================

1. Enviromnent.
---------------

The environment variable RTEST_HOME must be set to the rtest
top-level directory.

Usually:

  setenv RTEST_HOME $TITAN_HOME/rtest

The directory $RTEST_HOME/bin must be in the path.

TITAN binaries must be installed and in the path.

2. Create the lookup tables.
----------------------------

Run create_rc_table.rtest. This stores the tables in
the tables directory.

3. Start the test.
------------------

Run start_rtest_all

4. Check display.
-----------------

After a few nimutes, the display should show radar data and 
storm track data.

5. Kill the test.
-----------------

Run kill_rtest_all.

6. Clean up the data and tables.
--------------------------------

Run delete_rtest_data and delete_rtest_tables.

DATA FLOW
=========

1. Test data creation.
----------------------
The program test2gate resamples radar data from a Cartesian
volume file stored in dobson format. The resampled data is
formatted into gate data format and made available on a
socket.

2. Ingest.
----------
polar_ingest ingests the data and places it in a shared memory
buffer. polar2mdv reads the buffers, performs the Cartesian 
transformation and stores the data in MDV files in the
cdata directory.

3. Storm tracking.
------------------
storm_ident identifies the storms in the MDV files and stores
the results in storms files in the storms directory. storm_ident
communicates with storm_tarck via shared memory, coordinating
the two programs. storm_track tracks the identified storms and
stores the results in track files in the storms directory.

4. Precip products.
-------------------
precip_map is run to procuce a forecast and accumulation product.
These are stored in MDV files in the precip_fcast and precip_accum
directories.

5. Reflectivity forecast.
-------------------------
precip_map is run to procuce a reflectivity forecast product.
This is stored in MDV files in the refl_fcast directories.

6. Forecast monitor.
--------------------
forecast_monitor is run to monitor the accuracy of the forecasts.
The results are stored in the fmon directory.

7. Data servers.
----------------
The dobson_server is used to serve out the MDV file data. The track
server serves out storm and track data.

8. Displays.
------------
rview and time_hist read data from the servers.
