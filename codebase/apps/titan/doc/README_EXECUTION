A series of scripts have been set up to show how the TITAN system
may be used. After installation is complete, these scripts should be
found in $TITAN_HOME/scripts.

The programs run by these scripts make use of the parameter files
copied to $TITAN_HOME/scripts during installation.

You will need an NCAR format tape to run these scripts, or a
tape format supported by rdata_to_socket.

Hardware requirements
=====================

The TITAN system requires UNIX and X-Windows.

The TITAN processes may be run on a single machine with about 64 Mbytes
of memory, or two machines with about 32 Mbytes of memory each.

Many of the programs require shared memory segments for communication.
The kernel must be compiled for the shared memory option, preferably
with at least 4 Mbyte segments. If you have smaller segments, you may need
to cut down on the size of the Cartesian volume grid.

Overview of script examples
===========================

A machine (in this example called 'tornado') with a tape drive reads
an NCAR format radar tape. Data is read from this tape by
rdata_to_socket and is transmitted across the network to a second
machine. All of the remaining processes run on the second machine,
which is referred to as 'local' in the parameter files. The actual
machine name could be substituted for 'local'.

The data transmitted by rdata_to_socket is ingested by rdata_to_shmem
and placed into a shared memory buffer. dobson_from_shmem reads this
buffer, transforms the data into Cartesian space and stores files in
the $TITAN_HOME/cdata directory. dobson_from_shmem also transmits the
data beam-by-beam to cart_slave which keeps an up-to-date volume in
shared memory for real-time display purposes.

The dobson_server program reads both the up-to-date volume and the
Cartesian disk files and makes them available to the display. A
second dobson_server serves out precip forecast data.

The program storm_ident reads the Cartesian volumes and identifies
storms in them. It starts up storm_track which tracks the storms.
The program track_server serves out this track data to the display, and
also provides a shared memory area for communication between storm_ident
and storm_track. Storm and track files reside in directory
$TITAN_HOME/storms.

The program precip_map reads the storm track files and produces a
precipitation forecast in a file, in directory
$TITAN_HOME/precip_forecast.

The display programs rview and time hist access the dobson_server and
track_server programs via sockets, and display the data.

Optionally, the programs clutter_compute and clutter_table_generate may
be run to prepare the system for clutter removal.

Adjusting parameter files
=========================

To use these scripts, you need to change the name 'tornado' to
that of the machine which you will use to run rdata_to_socket.
You may also need to change the name of the tape drive, which 
is set to /dev/rst0.

The scripts
===========

run_rctable_generate generates the radar-to-Cartesian lookup tables.

start_tape starts reading the tape.

start_ingest starts the ingest and Cartesian transformation programs.

start_servers starts up the data servers.

start_tracking starts up the storm tracking.

start_display starts the display.


Optional - clutter removal
==========================

setup_clutter_table copies some radar files to the clutter directory
and runs the clutter table generation programs. This example expects
that the NCAR data tape from July 10 1990 is used. It uses the files
between 1700 and 2000 GMT for clutter computations. If you are using a
different tape, edit the script to copy over about 20 files without
weather activity in them.

If the clutter computations have been done, you can use
start_ingest_remove_clutter instead of start_ingest.
