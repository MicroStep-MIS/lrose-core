The distribution is available via anonymous ftp on
thunder.rap.ucar.edu (128.117.192.14). The user must be licenced
through UCAR to legally download the distribution. All ftp activity
on thunder is logged.

Use anonymous ftp, and your full username as a password.

  cd pub/dixon
  binary
  get titan2.0.tar.Z

Uncompress the tar file:

  uncompress titan2.0.tar.Z

Make a directory for the distribution. At RAP we name this directory
'rap' for all of the RAP source, so if you name it rap it may make
things easier for you.

We will assume you have set an environment variable RAP_DIR to point
to this directory.

Move the tar file there, and extract with:

  tar xvf titan2.0.tar

You should then have the following subdirectories:

  $RAP_DIR/doc
  $RAP_DIR/make_bin
  $RAP_DIR/make_include
  $RAP_DIR/libraries
  $RAP_DIR/projects

Refer to README_INSTALL for further information.
