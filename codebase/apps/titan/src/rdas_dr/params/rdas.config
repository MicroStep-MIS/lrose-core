1  - Base address of RVPC in hex
2  - Interrupt channel of RVPC
3  - Invert AZ/EL DAC output - 0 = neither 1 = EL 2 = AZ 3 = both
4  - Antenna slew roll off multiplier
5  - Elevation 'THERE' threshold
6  - Azimuth rpm set to 5.0 RPM (0 to 6.0)
7  - Elevation offset bias factor for Bethlehem Enterprise 65 is good
8  - Azimuth correction value
9  - Elevation correction value
10 - Exabyte tape density code must be set to 14Hex to maintain 8200 
     format on non 8200 units otherwise set this to 0 for old 8200 models
11 - Exabyte tape SCSI id number as set on exabyte tape drive
12 - TCP port A - 0 = NO SOCKET/ usualy set to 10000 for socket use
13 - Swap bytes socket A flag 0 = do not swap 1 = swap for non intel systems
14 - TCP port B - 0 = NO SOCKET/ usualy set to 15000 for socket use
15 - Swap bytes socket B flag 0 = do not swap 1 = swap for non intel systems
16 - Radar trigger alignment in micro seconds(gets added to skip)
17 - Auto recovery timeout count in seconds ( this time must be greater than the
     time it takes to slew from the top elevation to the base scan elevation )
