info on fields:

magnitude (wind speed) is in m/s
phase (direction) is in degrees
rainflag is 1 or 0

SCT     -45.72 -102.62 358.00   9.00 0 0 2006/08/09 13:21:14 281

"obs_name, lat, lon, phase, mag, bit13 (rain flag), bit14 (number of solutions), obs_date, obs_time sat_id"

sat_id or sensor number was added to allow distinction between different satellites. If the sensor is unkonwn it will be 999.

From Rob Wade: The nsolflag tells you which number the solution is for that single solution. Fleet puts out a ambiguity file that shows all the directions and they label them 0,1, 2 etc.. They typically use the 0 or 1 solution and I have no idea how they make these choices.
