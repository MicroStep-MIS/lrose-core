 <UL>

<LI>  One can't display grid cells smaller than the pixel size on
  your screen.  Current PC screens have at most about 3.2 Mpixels. Most
  windows and images are under 1 Mpixel. Do not deliver more grid cells
  than you can render. Use the nested grids and the decimation features
  on the MDV server to pair down the number of grid cells delivered to
  a display client. <br> <br>


<LI> Select a good image - rules of thumb :
   <UL>
		<LI> The image map projection has to be known and supported. You need to know the
		  projection parameters and the location of a corner,
		  and the exact pixel size in some known units of
		  measure. Many times this information is included in
		  a separate "geo" file or included in the header info.
		  Recovering this information is not within the scope
		  of this document. Follow the above links to some images
		  which have the required info.

        <LI> Keep images under 20 megapixels for better disk acesses.
		<LI> Use standard image tools to view and covert to a supported format
			(PNG,JPG,TIF,GIF)
		<LI> I use Imagemagic tools (convert, display, import etc) to do a bunch from
		the command line, which I record in simple scripts for repition.

		<LI> It takes a powerful machine to deal with images larger than 100 megapixels.
 </UL><br> <br>

<LI> Decimate huge images for improved performance. See the rules of thumb above. <br>
     Examples: <b> convert -geometry <width>x<height>+<x>+<y> input.img output.img  <br>
                   convert -resize <width>x<height> <br> </b>
     If you are running kde, the <b> kruler </b> utility can be very useful for helping
     to determine what pixels to extract.



	 Multiples of 2 work pretty well. Divide the image in 2 a couple of times to
	 get it under 40 Mpixels. <br> <br>

<LI> 	 Crop out small areas of the highest resolution images for your local / regional
	 views. Keep the nested images less than 40Mpixels. <br>

Here's the process with an example: <br>


Desired Domain - Picked visually. <br>
Lon:  -108 to -118 <br>
Lat: 36 to 44 <br> <br>

Original input image is on a lon/lat: grid = { -124.758, 49.3796, 0.00416667, -0.00416667 }; <br>

Do the math to relate the desire lat/lon range to the subimage pixel references : <br>

<B> (124.758 - 118) / 0.00416667 = 1621.9187 </b> -- the number of pixels to use for cropping <br>

Round to integer : <br>

1622 = Number to crop in X. <br> <br>

For any C/C++ coders reading this, in C this calculation might be written as : <br>
 <b> int numToCropX = (int)rint( ( ImageMinLon - DesiredMinLon ) / deltaLon); </b> <br> <br>

True ll corner into Image2Mdv param file: <br>

1622 * 0.00416667 + -124.758 = -117.99966 <br> 

Same for Latitude <br>

(49.3796 - 44 )/ -0.00416667 = 1291 crop <br>

1291 * 0.00416667 - 49.3796 = true new lat = 44.00039 <br> <br>

Now figure how how many pixels to crop TO (eg: width and height) <br> 

118 - 108 = 10 degrees <br>

10 degrees / -0.00416667 degr/pixel =~ 2400 pixels <br>
8 degrees / -0.00416667 degr/pixel =~ 1920 pixels <br>

Hence the convert command is : <br> <br>

<b> convert -crop 2400x1920+1622+1291 fromImage toImage </b>

</ul>

3.0 Additional information
</big></big></P>

<P>
If an image comes from a GIS system then it may have an ASCII file associated
with it describing the projection details of the grid. It has been
<A HREF=http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.techArticles.articleShow&d=17489> suggested </a>
that these files are known as <b> world files </b> and that their
format is :
<UL>
  <LI> Line 1: x-dimension of a pixel in map units
  <LI> Line 2: rotation parameter
  <LI> Line 3: rotation parameter
  <LI> Line 4: NEGATIVE of y-dimension of a pixel in map units
  <LI> Line 5: x-coordinate of center of upper left pixel
  <LI> Line 6: y-coordinate of center of upper left pixel 
</UL>
Which may not be enough to define the grid for our purposes.
</P>

<P>
If the image file name has a 3-character extension (image1.tif), the world file has
the same name followed by an extension containing the first and last letters of the
image's extension and ending with a 'w' (image1.tfw). If the extension has more or
less than 3 characters, including no extension at all, then the world file name is
formed by simply appending a 'w' to the image file name.
