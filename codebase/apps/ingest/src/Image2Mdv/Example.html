 Getting background imagery into CIDD from ESRI - an example
</big></big></big> </p>

<P>
Here is one approach.
</P>

<P> <B> Step One : </b> Get the ESRI system to produce images on
a lat/lon grid with a world file. <B> <I> This is essential </i> </b>
and I realise that if you're reading this, you may already have the
imagery you want and it's <i> not </i> lat/lon, or there is no world file.
What to do in that case is something of a "black art" and you are welcome
to see me and ask me to try to work with it, but no promises!
</P>

<P>
The good news (possibly) is that the format of the world file is
failry simple (see below) so if you know the details of the lat/lon
projection you have, you may be able to edit one.
</P>

<P> <B> Step Two : </b> Look at the world file
to check it for sanity. The filename will end in
"w" - for <b> boulder.jpg </b> the world file is <b> boulder.jgw </b>,
for <b> boulder.tif </b> the world file is <b> boulder.tfw. </b> If
it is on a lat/lon projection, it will look something like this :
<PRE>
0.0000090909
0.0000000000
0.0000000000
-0.0000090909
-105.3020984545
40.1371535545
</PRE>

The format of the file is :

<UL>
  <LI> Line 1: x-dimension of a pixel in map units (dx, degrees)
  <LI> Line 2: rotation parameter (should be 0.0)
  <LI> Line 3: rotation parameter (should be 0.0)
  <LI> Line 4: NEGATIVE of y-dimension of a pixel in map units (-dy, degrees)
  <LI> Line 5: x-coordinate of center of upper left pixel (longitude)
  <LI> Line 6: y-coordinate of center of upper left pixel (latitude)
</UL>
</P>


<P> <B> Step Three : </b> Get the dimensions of the image
with the <b> identify </b> command (or view it in xv, but
these images are typically very large so that might be a time consuming way to get Nx and Nx).
</P>

<P> <B> Step Four : </b> Chose the lat/lon range that needs to be
covered and decide on the number of points you need in X
for each image you want (ie. each CIDD zoom state). The
number of points in Y will be calculated for you to keep a
the aspect ratio consistent with the lat/lon range you
have specified.
</P>

<P>
Then generate a param file for the app apps/ingest/src/Image2MdvAdjunct
with the command <br> <br> <b>
Image2MdvAdjunct -print_params > Image2MdvAdjunct.params <br> <br> </b>
Edit the lat/lon range information (along with the information from
step three and various other tidbits like the type of output image
you want and the filename for the input image) into this param file.
Be sure that <b> Image2Mdv </b> is in your path, ie. the system can
find that executable.
</P>

<P>
<b> NOTE: </b> The app apps/ingest/src/Image2MdvAdjunct/adjunctAdjunct
may be useful in setting up the param file for Image2MdvAdjunct.
</P>

<P> <B> Step Five : </b> Run 
<b> Image2MdvAdjunct -params Image2MdvAdjunct.params </b> which
will procude a csh script named <B> Runner </b> and param files
to drive the <b> convert </b> program and <b> Image2Mdv. </b>
</P>

<P>
Then run the <B> Runner </b> script, which will produce MDV files. It
will drive the <b> convert </b> program, which is uses a lot
of resources and may take some time.
</P>
