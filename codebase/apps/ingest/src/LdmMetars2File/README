The idea of LdmMetars2File is that you can point it at a directory
where metar files named InputDir/YYYYMMDD/YYYYMMDDHH.METAR are (the
most recent one will be growing) and it will periodically write
output files to OutDir/metar.YYYYMMDDHHmm - and these files
do _not_ grow.

The output files may then be used to make an SPDB.
