!! THIS CODE HAS BEEN REPLACED BY Nexrad2Netcdf. 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

To date (Nov. 22, 2005) the major differences include:

   1. REC: Nexrad2Netcdf contains the REC calculation. This required
      a significant refactoring.

   2. Ldm input: Nexrad2Netcdf no longer makes the system call
      that nexrad2netcdf makes to nexradBzUncompress. That code
      is part of the Nexrad2Netcdf application instead. In addition,
      nexrad2netcdf makes use of the file naming convention for
      the input LDM files, whereas Nexrad2Netcdf uses the latest
      data info mechanism in DsInputPath.

   3. Power ratio computation: nexrad2netcdf did considerable work
      to avoid creating additional arrays for the power ratio
      computation, whereas Nexrad2Netcdf does not. The end result 
      of this is twofold. First, in nexrad2netcdf the power ratio
      computation in the lower tilts is slightly different than
      that in the upper tilts. In the lower tilts the power ratio
      computation is done first and then the duplication is
      performed. In the upper tilts the duplciation of the 
      reflectivity field is performed first, and then the computation
      of the power ratio field is performed. In Nexrad2Netcdf,
      in both the lower tilts and the upper tilts, the duplication
      is performed first and then the power ratio computation is
      performed. In addition, Nexrad2Netcdf makes use of the
      floating point (double) version of snr to calculate 
      power ratio. This results in slightly more accurate results
      of the power ratio field in general.
