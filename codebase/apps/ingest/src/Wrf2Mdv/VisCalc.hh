     * This routine computes horizontal visibility at the lowest sigma

     * kg/kg units, whereas the hydrometeor mixing ratios are passed in as
     * g/kg.  At each grid point, the routine assigns values of total
     * liq. eq. precip, total liq.  equiv. cloud, rain, snow, cloud
     * water, and cloud ice, based on the value of iice.
     *
     * If iice=0:
     * qprc=qra     qrain=qra and qclw=qcw if T>0C
     * qcld=qcw          =0           =0   if T<0C
     *             qsnow=qsn and qclice=qcw  if T<0C
     *                  =0             =0    if T>0C
     *
     * If iice=1:
     * qprc=qra+qsn   qrain=qra and qclw=qcw
     * qcld=qcw+qci   qsnow=qsn and qclice=qcw
     *
     * Independent of the above definitions, the scheme can use different
     * assumptions of the state of hydrometeors:
     *   meth='d': qprc is all frozen if T<0, liquid if T>0
     *   meth='b': Bocchieri scheme used to determine whether qprc
     *      is rain or snow. A temperature assumption is used to
     *      determine whether qcld is liquid or frozen.
     *   meth='r': Uses the four mixing ratios qrain, qsnow, qclw,
     *      and qclice
     *
     * The routine uses the following
     * expressions for extinction coefficient, beta (in km**-1),
     * with C being the mass concentration (in g/m**3):
     *
     * cloud water:  beta = 144.7 * C ** (0.8800)
     * rain water:   beta =  2.24 * C ** (0.7500)
     * cloud ice:    beta = 327.8 * C ** (1.0000)
     * snow:         beta = 10.36 * C ** (0.7776)
     *
     * These expressions were obtained from the following sources:
     * for cloud water: from Kunkel (1984)
     * for rainwater: from Marshall-Palmer distribution,
     *    with No=8e6 m**-4 and rho_w=1000 kg/m**3
     * for cloud ice: assume randomly oriented plates which follow
     *    mass-diameter relationship from Rutledge and Hobbs (1983)
     * for snow: from Stallabrass (1985), assuming beta = -ln(.02)/vis
     *
     * The extinction coefficient for each water species present is
     * calculated, and then all applicable betas are summed to yield
     * a single beta. Then the following relationship is used to
     * determine visibility (in km), where epsilon is the threshhold
     * of contrast, usually taken to be .02:
     *
     * vis = -ln(epsilon)/beta      [found in Kunkel (1984)]
     *
     * Publication reference:
     * Nonhydrostatic, Mesobeta-Scale Model Simulations of Cloud Ceiling
     * and Visibility for an East Coast Winter Precipitation Event;
