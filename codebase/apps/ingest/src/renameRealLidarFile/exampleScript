# This is an example of how to run the software that
# copies REAL lidar files with a name change and does
# some statistics on the data and writes the statistics
# to a file.
#
# You need to have the ./bin directory in your path for this
# to work.
#
# First, copy the files with a name change from
# the input directory to an output directory.
# The output dir will be created if it does not exist.
#
renameLidarDirectoryFiles ./sampleInData ./sampleOutData
#
# In this example, the file 024.dat in sampleInData/ has
# been copied with a name change to
# sampleOutData/REAL_ONE_20070821_054546.lidar
#

#
# Then, do some statistics on the data in this new
# directory that holds the renamed files. This requires
# that the parameter file realLidarStats.params be set
# up.
#
checkLidarDir ./sampleOutData
#
# After this, the following files will have been written
# in ./sampleOutData :
#
# REAL_20070821_054546.beamStats - beam-by-beam stats. This is an
# ASCII file, the cols are :
#
# beam unix_time year month day hour min sec numValidGates minVal meanVal maxVal
#
#
# REAL_20070821_054546.FileStats - overall stats. This is a four line file,
# on the first line is the time of the first beam, on the next line is the mean
# time for the beams in the file and on the third line is the last beam time
# in the file. On the last line are the number of valid gates considered,
# the min, mean and max gat values.
#
# REAL_ONE_20070821_054546.lidar.check - a log file that will
#                  contain errors from the processing of the file
#                  when getting the statistics.
