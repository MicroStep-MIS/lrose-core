Title:	Running the SIGMET/AIRMET decoder
Date:	08-JUL-2003
================================================================================
The SIGMET/AIRMET decoder has been run on 2 different input data streams to
date.

1) LDM data from the /weather/ddp cross-mount on a RAP-located host in the
   Oceanic Weather project.

2) GTS data from the CAA serial data feed in the Taiwan project



LDM
---
If you use the LDM data feed, which does not have a _latest_data_info
mechanism, the SIGMETS are read from hourly SIGMET files and the
decoder is run in "archive" mode to read an input data file and
exit. See the code example below for the start script used to run the
decoder. This script is run hourly from cron.


GTS
---
If you use a data feed with the _latest_data_info mechanism available,
you can run the decoder under the auto restarter and have it poll for
data.


Station list files
------------------
Station list files and FIR boundary files for use by the decoder can 
be found in CVS under:

   projects/aoaws/rte/sigairmet/params/fir_list.txt and station_location.txt



Example start script to run SigAirMet2Spdb on the LDM data feed
---------------------------------------------------------------
#! /bin/csh
#
# This script should NOT be run under the proc_list and the auto_restart
# it needs to be run under cron on approximately an hourly basis.
# The reason for this is that the LDM data does NOT have _latest_data_info
# files. This script needs to run once and exit.
