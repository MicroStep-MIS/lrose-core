This is the program that is used to decompress nexrad
level II data when it is delivered via the LDM. At
RAP, this program is usually invoked with a system()
call by the nexrad2dsr radar ingest program. As a
stand alone utility, the syntax to run this is
something like :

nexradII_bz -C BZIP2    unzipped/015758_60.DAT < zipped/015758_60.BZIP2

The program requires that the bzip2 libraries be installed
in order to build.

The program was obtained from Harry Edmon at the
University of Washington (harry@atmos.washington.edu).
The source was obtained at :

ftp://ftp.atmos.washington.edu/harry/nexradII.tgz

 -- This source relied on parts of the ldm library. The
ldm library was duly downloaded from UniData and the parts
of the library that this program relies on were pulled out
and brought into this directory - essentially pulling
a subset of the library into the application.
