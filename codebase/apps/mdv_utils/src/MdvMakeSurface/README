The motivation for this program is simple : CIDD
currently recognises fields that have dz=0 and minz=0
as being surface data. In this event CIDD will print
"Field X at surface" rather than "Field X at elevation Y".

MDV files exist whicha are surface data, but for some reason
do not have dz=0.0 and minz=0.0. Hence this program.

Usage is 

MdvMakeSurface infile outfile

Fields with more than one plane (nz != 1) are
not modified.
