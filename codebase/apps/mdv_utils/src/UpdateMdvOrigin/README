UpdateMdvOrigin was written as a "quick fix" to
move the origin (lat, lon, grid_minx, grid_miny) in
MDV files. This is desired since our servers currently
have a problem if the origin of flat earth projection
data is anywhere other than the center of the
grid. UpdateMdvOrigin was copied from UpdateMdvFieldNames.

UpdateMdvFieldNames was copied almost wholesale from
update_mdv_times (by Nancy Rehak) - only minor edits
were required to change the short field names rather 
than adding an offset to the file times.
