This is a small program that takes an MDV file and prints,
for each plane in each field, what percentage of the data
is either bad or missing.

The intention is to avoid having to run CIDD to establish
if any valid data has been produced. This may be useful when
connecting to a very remote machine, or for debugging in a
development environment.

Usage : MdvHowBad <filename>

The filename is prompted for if it is not supplied on
the command line.

The minimum and maximum of the data are also displayed.
