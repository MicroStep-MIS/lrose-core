The WorldTerrain program is used to process the USGS Digital Elevation
Model (DEM) data files into ASCII or MDV files (MDV can then be converted
into netCDF). It is probably best explained by the following script that
runs the program.
</P>

#!/bin/csh <BR>
# <BR>
# This is a script to run the WorldTerrain program to extract two <BR>
# MDV files covering Afghanistan from the USGS elevation <BR>
# dataset. It is well documented so I can point <BR>
# other people at it. If you want to extract terrain data, <BR>
# copy this file to another name and edit the <BR>
# commands that run WorldTerrain at the bottom of this <BR>
# file. <BR>
# <BR>
# One file is at the maximum resolution of the <BR>
# USGS dataset (0.00833333333333 degrees in latitude <BR>
# and longitude) and the other covers a wider area <BR>
# at a lower resolution. <BR>
# <BR>
# For the WorldTerrain program to run, all the USGS <BR>
# Digital Elevation Model (DEM) files must be in one <BR>
# directory. This is something of a hassle since a <BR>
# lot of disk space is needed (Just under 1.9 GB).  <BR>
# At the time of writing this is too much for one CD. <BR>
# The DEM files are unpacked on <BR>
# <BR>
# aoaws@venus:/d1/terrain <BR>
# <BR>
# And the software (including a copy of this script) is in : <BR>
# <BR>
# aoaws@venus:/d1/terrain/prog <BR>
# <BR>
# <BR>
# Myself, Deirdre Garvey, Frank Hage and Mike Dixon <BR>
# know the password for aoaws@venus. <BR>
# <BR>
# The WorldTerrain  program is checked in as : <BR>
# <BR>
# apps/mdv_utils/src/WorldTerrain  <BR>
# <BR>
# The program is not efficient. For each grid point,  <BR>
# it opens a DEM file, reads an elevation value, and  <BR>
# then closes the DEM file again. The upshot is that <BR>
# a given DEM file will probably be read several times. <BR>
# <BR>
# Also the program produces only lat/lon projection MDV files. <BR>
# <BR>
# For these reasons, it is best to run the program only <BR>
# to initially extract the terrain data. Remapping the <BR>
# data onto other grid projections is probably best done by <BR>
# running MdvResample on the output of WorldTerrain. <BR>
# <BR>
# WorldTerrain also produces ascii data in the files <BR>
# ascii.dat, ascii.lat and ascii.lon. The file ascii.dat <BR>
# is a two dimensional ASCII file that has the whole grid <BR>
# in it, ascii.lon and ascii.lat are one dimensional and <BR>
# have the longitudes and latitudes used for the grid in them. <BR>
# <BR>
# The program just uses the nearest appropriate DEM point,  <BR>
# there is no internal interpolation. <BR>
# <BR>
# --------------------------------------------------------- <BR>
# <BR>
# To run the program, the usage is : <BR>
# <BR>
# <B> WorldTerrain DEM_DIR ll_lat ll_lon Nx Ny Dx Dy Outfilename </B> <BR>
# <BR>
# Where : <BR>
# <BR>
# <B> DEM_DIR </B> is the directory where the USGS DEM files are, <BR>
# <B> ll_lat </B> is the lower left latitude, <BR>
# <B> ll_lon </B> is the lower left longitude, <BR>
# <B> Nx  </B> is the number of points to extract in the longitude direction, <BR>
# <B> Ny </B> is the number of points to extract in the latitude direction, <BR>
# <B> Dx </B> is the increment in longitude, in degrees, <BR>
# <B> Dy </B> is the increment in latitude, in degrees, and <BR>
# <B> Outfilename </B> is the MDV filename, with extension. <BR>
# <BR>
# <BR>
# First the small coverage, high resolution file : <BR>
# <BR>
<B> WorldTerrain ../ 25.0 60.0 1801 1801 0.00833333333333 0.00833333333333  Afghan_HiRes.mdv </B> <BR>
# <BR>
# That should cover 25N to 40N and 60E to 75E (you have to do some <BR>
# minor math to get the coverage you want). <BR>
# <BR>
# <BR>
# Then the wider coverage, lower resolution file : <BR>
# <BR>
<B> WorldTerrain ../ 15.0 45.0 901 601 0.05 0.05 Afghan_WideArea.mdv </B> <BR>
# <BR>
# That should cover 15N to 45N and 45E to 90E <BR>
