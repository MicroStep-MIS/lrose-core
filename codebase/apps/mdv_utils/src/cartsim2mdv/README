cartsim2mdv....
	reads cartesian simulation config. parameters and, for each time
	specified, creates 3 dimensional cartesian data and writes
	out to a MDV format file.

Notes:

1. a conflict between tetwws and dataport (both used) as follows:

     /usr/bin/../lib/ld:
     Warning: /home/dave/lib/libtetwws.a(be.o): BE_is_big_endian: multiply defined
	   previous (used) definition from '/rap/lib/libdataport.a';
	   new (ignored) definition from '/home/dave/lib/libtetwws.a'


2. The simulation config file has an environment variable
CSIM_MAPPING_DIR that points to the directory with needed mapping
files utilda, stilda, w, wr_max.  Examples can be found in
../../../sim/src/spline_plot.

3. Examples of the config files are found in libs/sim/src/cart_sim


	Examples of this file are found in ../lobe_create

4. The fields created are wind u, wind v, wind w, dbz, snr, sw.
