InitClimate and UpdateClimate are two programs that operate 
together to generate a clear sky climatology of maximum temperatures
and minimum reflectances. The programs must be run on a year's worth
of data in order to generate the complete climatology.

The steps to use the programs are as follows.

1/ Define the environment variable CLEAR_SKY_CLIMATOLOGY_DIR
	to point to the directory where the climatology MDV files
	will be written to. There will be one file for each month
	and one for each hour => 288 files.

2/ Find an MDV file of satellite data of the type that will be used
	in the climatology, say 'START.mdv', and give the command

	prompt>InitClimate START.mdv

	288 files with initial values will be written under the
	CLEAR_SKY_CLIMATOLOGY_DIR.

3/ Run the UpdateClimate program, which will live in the background
	watching for new data and process it when it comes along.
	Generate a param file with the -print_params option and
	edit it - the only thing I think will need to be changed
	is the input directory. If MDV files are written like :

	whatever/blah/YYYYMMDD/hhmmss.mdv

	Then the input directory should be :

	whatever/blah

	Note that UpdateClimate, like InitClimate, needs the
	variable CLEAR_SKY_CLIMATOLOGY_DIR set.

FINAL COMMENTS

	Fields in the MDV file are recognised by name, if the
	short field name is 'temperature' then a brightness
	temperature field is assumed, otherwise albedo is assumed.

	Once initiated, everything should remain static - do not change
	field order or size in the input MDV files.

	Only run the InitClimate program if you want to erase the climatology
	and start again. UpdateClimate can run pretty well any
	time. It does not matter if it runs several times on the same data.
