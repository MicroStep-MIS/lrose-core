UpdateMdvFieldNames was copied almost wholesale from
update_mdv_times (by Nancy Rehak) - only minor edits
were required to change the short field names rather 
than adding an offset to the file times.

The program was motivated by a new version of CIDD that uses
the short field name to determine what field to display.
A lot of MDV files exist for GOES satellite data that have
the short field name "temperature" for all infra red fields - CIDD
will only be able to display the first one in this case.

Moved test parameter files and control scripts to
apps/mdv_utils/test/UpdateMdvFieldNames.
