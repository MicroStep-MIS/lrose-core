<H1>MdvServer User's Guide</H1>

This document describes how run the MdvServer process and how
to set up clients to use the server.


<H2>1. Command Line</H2>

The MdvServer is started with the following command line:

<P>
<PRE>
MdvServer <I>options</I>
</PRE>

<P>
where the following options are valid:

<P>
<DL>

<DT><KBD>-help</KBD>
<DD>print the command usage to stdout.

<P>
<DT><KBD>-port <I>number</I></KBD>
<DD>the port number to be used by the server.
This option MUST be specified or the MdvServer will exit.

<P>
<DT><KBD>-qmax <I>seconds</I></KBD>
<DD>the maximum quiescent time in seconds.
The server will exit if no requests are received within this time period.
If <KBD>-qmax</KBD> isn't specified on the command line, the server will
run indefinitely.

<P>
<DT><KBD>-params <I>file</I></KBD>
<DD>default parameter file to be used by this server.
The server will use this parameter file unless there is a different
parameter file specified in the URL or there is a
<KBD>.MdvServer.default</KBD> parameter file in the data store directory.

<P>
<DT><KBD>-print_params</KBD>
<DD>Print the default parameter file to stdout.

</DL>

The <KBD>-port</KBD>, <KBD>-qmax</KBD> and <KBD>-params</KBD> options
are supported so that this server can be managed by the DIDSS
(Data Ingest and Distributed Server System) server manager.

<P>
When running the MdvServer within the DIDSS, do NOT start the process
by hand.
Instead, let the server manager start the process.
Any MdvServer process started by hand within the DIDSS will be ignored
by the rest of the system and a redundant server will be started by
the server manager.


<H2>2. Client Set-up</H2>

Setting a client up to use an MdvServer is as easy as using
the appropriate RAP URL in the client.
Generally, the URL will be specified in the client's parameter file.

<P>
To have the client go through the DIDSS data mapper and server manager
to find the data, leave the host and port specifications blank in the
URL.
The client will then get the host name from the data mapper and then
get the port number from the server manager.

<P>
To use a particular MdvServer (generally one that was started by hand),
specify both the host and the port in the URL.
