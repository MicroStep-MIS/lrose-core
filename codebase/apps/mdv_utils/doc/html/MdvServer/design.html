<H1>MdvServer Design Document</H1>

This document describes the high level design of the MdvServer process.
The MdvServer serves MDV data to requesting clients using the
MDV protocol.


<H2>1. Requests</H2>

The MdvServer receives requests over a socket.
The request includes a RAP URL that describes the location of the data set
and any special parameter files to be used to satisfy the request.

<P>
The data set directory is the subdirectory of the 
<KBD>$RAP_DATA_DIR/mdv</KBD> directory that was specified in the URL.

<P>
If a parameter file is specified in the URL or if a
<KBD>.MdvServer.default</KBD> parameter file exists in the data directory,
the MdvServer uses this parameter file when fulfilling the request.
If both exists, the parameter file specified in the URL is used.

<P>
The server responds to the request by either writing to the specifed
data set directory, or by reading from the directory, processing the
data and passing it back to the client.

<H3>1.1 Put Requests</H3>

There is only one type of put request supported by the MdvServer.
For this type of request, the client must put together all of the
MDV information for the new file and send this information to the
MdvServer.
The server will then create a new file containing this information.
If this file already exists, the server decides whether to override
the existing file based on a flag in the put request.


<H3>1.2 Data Time Requests</H3>

The MdvServer allows the client to request a list of available data
times so the client can decide which data is most appropriate before
making a request.
The client specifies a time range of interest to reduce the size of the
returned list.


<H3>1.3 Get Requests</H3>

The MdvServer supports several types of get requests for retrieving
non-forecast data:

<UL>
<LI>Get closest data to the given time.
<LI>Get first data before the given time.
<LI>Get first data after the given time.
<LI>Get the latest data.
<LI>Get the latest data after the given time.
</UL>

<P>
The get closest, get first before and get first after requests are usually
used by clients in archive mode while the get latest and get latest after
requests are usually used in realtime mode.

<P>
To request forecast data, the client must first request the list of
available data times.
Using this list, the client must then request the data explicitly
by specifying the generation time and the forecast time desired.

<P>
The client may request all of the data fields in the file be returned
or may specify a single field to be returned.
This field may be specified either by field name or by field number.
The field number is the 0-based position of the field in the MDV file.

<P>
The client may request the entire data volume for the field(s),
may specify a single plane of the data to be returned,
or may indicate that no data be returned.
In the last case, only the MDV header information is returned
to the client.

<P>
All of the get requests include information that allow the client to
request the following operations to be performed on the data before
the data is returned:

<UL>
<LI>Horizontal cropping of the data.
<LI>Vertical cropping of the data.
<LI>Data compositing.
<LI>Vertical cross-sectioning of the data.
</UL>

<P>
The client may request any or all of these operations
(of course, combining data compositing and vertical cross-sections
in a single request will result in very little data being returned!).
The operations are then applied in the order listed above.


<H2>2. Running Within the DIDSS System</H2>

The MdvServer fits into the DIDSS (Data Ingest and Distributed Server
System) as shown in the following diagram:

<P>
<IMG SRC=didss.gif>

<P>
In DIDSS, the server manager spawns the MdvServer process at the
first request for MDV services.
The MdvServer then waits for client requests over the port assigned
to it by the server manager.
When the server receives a data get request, it retrieves the
requested data from the data store and returns that data to the client.
When the server receives a data put request, it writes that data to
the data store, tells the client whether the put was successful and
updates the latest data information in the local data mapper.


<H2>3. Running Independently</H2>

The MdvServer can also be run independently of the DIDSS system.
To operate this way, the user must start the MdvServer process by
hand and the clients must explicitly specify the port number in
the request URL (so the server manager will be bypassed).
