This program is a template for fixing minor problems in Spdb Databases.

The program has a generic core which loads spdb records from a directory
and then writes them back out to the same or another directory.
It applies some random fix in the middle, for example removing bad data
points, or resetting the wind direction, applying some scale or bias to
the data values.

ALWAYS RUN THE PROGRAM, PLACING THE OUTPUT IN A SEPARATE DIRECTORY!

It's really easy to move files between directories. It much harder to
retrieve overwritten data.

Run the program: 'spdb_repair input_db_url out_db_url start_time end_time'

In order for you to use this program template, you'll have to modify it
to include the Spdb chunk data structure definitions for your product and the
specific code that affects ther "repair".. 

Don't worry about code that fixes other product types. It won't get called
unless your data types match. The code is left there as an example. Add or
replace code as needed to repair your spdb data.
