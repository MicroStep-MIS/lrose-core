# CIDD's README

# -F. Hage.  Feb 1994.
# Last Update:  12/12/-00- F. Hage - HTML'ized 
# Still lacks list of current ancillary programs
</PRE>


<P>
Cidd has two major code branches: "Little cidd",
which has the original code base as used and fielded from 1991 to
1998. "Big CIDD" is the code base that is currently being maintained and
went into use in late 1998 and throughout 1999. Its code has been
"cleaned up" and converted to compile under C++, although the design
remains primarily procedural C code. The new CIDD also uses the common
C++ class libaries for accessing data and ingests and renders Symbolic product data
natively.

<P>
Major enhancements in the new CIDD code base:
<UL>
<LI> Unified config files in to one param file with delineated sections.
<LI> Now uses URLs to designate sources of data.
<LI> Only one server per machine need be run to serve out all gridded data.
<LI> Can use HTTP (protocol)  to load config files including Maps and Colorscales.
<LI> Can use HTTP proxies and a "data tunnel" to pass data through port 80
  for both outgoing and incoming firewalls.
<LI> Has a configurable main menu bar, which allows for customised and specialised
   control setups.
<LI> Has a simple, integrated mechanism to draw features for export into product
  databases.
<LI> Has hooks for driving netscape to specific URLS for help info and supplementary data.

CIDD related Applications and their Configuration Files:

<P>
CIDD Uses a unified configuration file delineated by XML like tags.

<P> Usage: <H4> CIDD -p http://www.rap.ucar.edu/CIDD/front_range &amp; </H4>

<UL>
<LI>   &lt;GRIDS&gt; section:   Determines which Gridded data sources are available from 
        CIDD's menus. Specified the Labels, URL, colorscale, units label
	default contour levels, rendering style, etc.

<LI>   &lt;WINDS&gt; section: Determines which data fields will be represented by wind 
	vectors, or barbs. Sets their Label, URL, colors, etc..

<LI>   &lt;MAPS&gt; section:  Determines which map overlays are loaded, on by default,
   	and their initial colors. Note that these files are in the same format
	as the product files that prds and exprt are compatible with.

<LI>    &lt;DRAW_EXPORT&gt; section:  Determines parameters used to export simple line based
		  features to other programs. 

<LI> &lt;MAIN_PARAMS&gt;  Contains most of start up parameters, such as window sizes, fonts, 
       menu configurations, zoom defines, map projection, the location/URL
       of the map and colorscale files, and many other parameters which
       control basic functionality and capabilities.

<LI> COLORSCALES:  Each line in the &lt;GRIDS&gt; section specifies a colorscale file.
                    They are read either from a http URL or directly from a 
		    local directory. CIDD first looks for a copy in the local
		    directory, which allows one to used modified colorscales.

<LI> MAP FILES:    Each overlay file listed in the &lt;MAPS&gt; section is loaded
		    from the givven http URL or a specified directory.
