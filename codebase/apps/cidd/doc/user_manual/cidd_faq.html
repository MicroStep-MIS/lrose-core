<A name="Q1.1"> 
<B> 1.1 Fonts do not fit in the buttons. The menus and panels look
	  terrible and some elements are obscured. What is going on and,
	  most importantly, how can I fix it? </B>

   A: The XView toolkit that CIDD uses as a GUI layer has a relatively
	  ambiguous specification for its default font. It finds a
	  really big font because your X server lists big fonts first
	  when it sets up the default X font path and XView does
	  not scale the size of the widgets to fit the fonts.
	  <P> A simple way to fix this problem is to reverse the order
	  of the 75 dpi and 100 dpi font directories in your XServer
	  configuration file, where it sets the default  font path,
	  and then restart the X server.  You'll need root privilege
	  to modify the /etc/X11/XF86Config* file.
	  <BR>(*It may have a different name on your system)
	  <P>You can also set your individual font path using 'xset
	  fp=...'.  Use 'fp -q' to query what your X settings are
	  currently.
	  <P> Advanced control can be had via the OpenWindows X resources
	  which control much of the look of the GUI, including which fonts
	  are used.  See 'man 7x xview' on a Linux box with the libraries
	  installed for detailed information. Skip over the first Usage
	  section to the section on 'Command Line Resource Arguments'.
	  Place these in your .Xresources file or use 'xrdb' from the
	  command line.
