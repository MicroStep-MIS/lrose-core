<H3>Configurable, Interactive Data Display (CIDD) <BR> Documents, Information and Examples</H3>

One of the unfortunate things about CIDD is its lack of good, comprehensive
documentation.  CIDD has been under development off and on since
March of 1991 and RAP's projects have always chosen to fund feature
additions rather than documentation. Please look at the following
documents, or go through some of the <A HREF="../cidd_examples.html">
sample configuration files </A> and then call me at 303-494-8413
if you need additional information or help.
