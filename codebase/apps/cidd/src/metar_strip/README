This is a hacked version of gauge_strip (from the
wsddm project) for the Taiwan project. Although the
final executable is called metar_strip, the
source files are named as they were for  gauge_strip.

The only change is that precip rate and
precip accum have been replaced by ceiling
and visibility.

This is something of a "quick fix" as we are near
to shipping a version - in the long term, a whole
new program will be written since gauge_strip needs to
be updated to C++.
