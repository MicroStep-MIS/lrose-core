 <P ALIGN=CENTER> <B> <big> modelView Technical Support </big> </b> </P>

<P>
This is some technical support for the modelView AJAX setup that allows the web display
of images that CIDD dumps. The code is checked in under <B> apps/cidd/src/modelView </b>
in the RAL CVS repository.
</P>

<P>
To get it going, do the following on a machine that has a web server running 
with PHP available :
</P>

<P>
<B>  [1] </b> Get the model to dump images with names like  200601060500/d1_2mtempA10mwnd.gif
into the subdirectory "images" this directory is usually a link).
</P>

<P>

<B> [2] </b> Once the model is dumping images, edit the modelView.php file and change the
     names of the fields, zoom states, heights etc. - there are comments in
     there that will tell you what to do.
</P>
<P>
<b> [3] </b> Link modelView.php to index.html with the command :
</P>
<P> <B>
ln -s modelView.php index.html
</B> </P>
<P>
Then point a browser at this directory.
It should be OK after a couple of debugging runs. The browser needs
to have javaScript enabled and be reasonably recent.
</P>
<P>
Please do be careful about making changes to the code without a system to
test if things are working after the changes you make! The distributed processing nature of
this system means that breaking it can lead to some difficult debugging - especially
if the browser is IE, which does not have as well developed debugging tools as
other browsers at the time of writing.
