<P>
modelView is a setup that allows the user to browse images that have been
created by a model. These models generally run on a UNIX system.
modelView can be accessed by any web browser that has javaScript enmabled.
</P>

<P>
modelView is generally self-explanitory and is probably best explored by
trying it. The only thing that needs some explanation is the text window
that allows the user to enter the end time for the data period, and
even then there are only a few points :
<UL>
 <LI> The format is YYYY-MM-DD_hh:mm:ss, ie. 2006-01-04_21:40:00
 <LI> Entering the text "now" puts the system back into realtime mode (the default)
 <LI> All times are UTC (or "Zulu time")
</UL>
</P>
<P>
This functionality seems to be a little brain-damaged if your browser is
Internet Explorer. In this case, immediately after entering the time you have
to click on the play button to get the time to apply. It looks like it does not
update automatically, and this is is the subject of ongoing development.
</P>

<P>
The "Status" button gives you information that may be useful for the developers
to know if you are reporting a problem.
