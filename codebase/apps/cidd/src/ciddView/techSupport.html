 <P ALIGN=CENTER> <B> <big> ciddView Technical Support </big> </b> </P>

<P>
This is some technical support for the ciddView AJAX setup that allows the web display
of images that CIDD dumps. The code is checked in under <B> apps/cidd/src/ciddView </b>
in the RAL CVS repository.
</P>

<P>
To get it going, do the following on a machine that has a web server running 
with PHP available :
</P>

<P>
<B>  [1] </b> Check out the code and get CIDD to dump *.jpg images into the subdirectory "images"
     (this directory is usually a link). This typically involves running CIDD like :
</P>
<P> <B>
     CIDD -u -p CIDD.real.dump -i real
</b> </P>
<P>
   Or :
</P>
<P> <B>
     CIDD -u -p CIDD.cti.dump -i cti -h -1,1.5,4,6.5,9,11,14,16,19,21,24 
</b> </P>
<P>
   For 3D fields. The latter is usually cron-driven with <B>"cidd.run_once_and_exit: 1"</b>
   in the param file. Other typical CIDD param file entries might be :
</P>
<P> <B>
   cidd.html_mode: 1 <BR>
   cidd.image_dir: images </b> (You will probably need a more complete path) <b> <BR>
   cidd.image_ext: jpg <BR>
   cidd.add_valid_time_to_filename: 0 <BR>
   cidd.add_gen_time_to_filename: 0 <BR>
   cidd.add_height_to_filename: 0 </B> (Should be 1 for the 3D case) <B> <BR>
   cidd.image_convert_script: ls <BR>
   cidd.series_convert_script: ls <BR>
   cidd.print_script: ls <BR>
</b> </P>
<P>

<B> [2] </b> Once CIDD is dumping images, edit the ciddView.php file and change the
     names of the fields, zoom states, heights etc. - there are comments in
     there that will tell you what to do. You may also have to edit make_prod.php
     as well, if you are presenting 3D data.
</P>
<P>
<b> [3] </b> Link ciddView.php to index.html with the command :
</P>
<P> <B>
ln -s ciddView.php index.html
</B> </P>
<P>
Then point a browser at this directory.
It should be OK after a couple of debugging runs. The browser needs
to have javaScript enabled and be reasonably recent.
</P>
<P>
Please do be careful about making changes to the code without a running system to
test if things are working after the changes you make! The distributed processing nature of
this system means that breaking it can lead to some difficult debugging - especially
if the browser is IE, which does not have as well developed debugging tools as
other browsers at the time of writing.
