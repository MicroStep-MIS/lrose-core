HiqDos2Dsr
----------

This source code is for the original Hiq2Dsr application that worked with
the DOS version of the HiQ.  It is being saved for use in TITAN systems
that are still using the DOS version, but has been replaced with the code
in Hiq2Dsr which works with the Windows version of the HiQ.  The application
built in the directory will be called "Hiq2Dsr" so that old system
configurations will not have to be changed, but this means that both
applications cannot be installed on a single machine.
