<H1> Validator </H1>     

<P>
The Validator is a program that generates statistics
about a forecasting method.
</P>
<P>
Its inputs are MDV files of forecasts, and
MDV files of what actually happened (truth
data). These files are then thresholded
to detect storms (a storm is detected if
the value, x, at a grid point is such that
lower_limit <= x <= upper_limit).
</P>

<P>
Statistics are generated and placed
in output files.
</P>

<P>
The validator can output intermediate MDV
files that show how it performed.
These files show how each grid point was detected
and used in the statistics.
</P>

<P>
It can also operate on a set of regions delineated
by a set of map files. In this
case multiple sets of statistics are generated
(but no intermediate MDV output is available in
this case).
</P>

<P>
A small MatLab script for plotting the statistics
is checked into the CVS repository under the
Validator/plot directory at the time of writing.
</P>

<P>
The Validator is run as follows :
</P>

<P>
Validator -start "YYYY MM DD hh mm ss" -end "YYYY MM DD hh mm ss" 
-params X.params
</P>

<P> 
Note that these times are <B> truth </B> times, not
forecast times.
</P>

<P>
If the Validator is run by cron (which is recommended for a field site)
then the <B> -yesterday </B> option can be used instead 
of the <B> -start </B> and <B> -end </B> options, viz.
</P>

<P>
Validator -yesterday -params X.params
</P>

<P>
Which will run the Validator on yesterday's data, <B> in the UTC </B>
timing convention.

<HR>
<H1> Parameters. </H1> 


<P> <B> TruthDir </B> </P>

<P>
Directory (actually URL now) for truth data.
This is the top directory under which
the MDV truth data is.
</P>


<HR>

<P> <B> ForecastDir </B> </P>

<P>
Directory (actually URL now) for forecast data.
This is the top directory under which
the MDV forecast data is.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> OutDir </B> </P>

<P>
Directory (actually URL now) in which to write MDV 
files of contingency tables.
These intermediate files serve as a diagnostic
by showing how the Validator treated each grid point.
</P>

<P>
Typically these files will be generated during the setup
of the Validator to see how it is performing - or
if the files are always produced, they will be scrubbed
fairly regularly. It is not intended that they be retained.
<P>

<P>
The files are time tagged by forecastTime + leadTime - which
is approximately the truth time. If the truth time were used, and
two forecasts were validated using the same truth, then the
output file would be overwritten. Tagging in this way ensures that
there will be an output file for each forecast file validated.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> StatsDir  </B> </P>

Directory in which to write statistical output.
These ASCII files are named Valid_YYYYMMDD_hhmmss_NAME.dat and are
MatLab loadable. The final summary is named
Valid_YYYYMMDD_hhmmss_NAME.final - in both cases the
time in the filename is the data time. For analyses of the whole
grid, NAME is set to Grid, otherwise for map files the
NAME is set to the name found in the map file.
</P>
<P>
The format of this file
is as follows :

 </Table>
</P>

<P>
The MatLab script PlotValid, which is checked into the
CVS repository in the subdirectory Validator/plot, can be
used to plot one of these files.
</P>

<HR>
<P> <B> FieldNumbersMustMatch </B> </P>

<P>
Both forecast and truth fields are identified by field name,
using parameters ForecastFieldName and TruthFieldName. The
user may also specify the field numbers they expect these fields
to have using ForecastFieldNum and TruthFieldNum. Past experience
has shown that erroneous post-processing can result in MDV
files in the input directories which have fields with the
correct name but at a different field number. These fields are invalid
and should be ignored.
</P>

<P>
If FieldNumbersMustMatch is TRUE, then the field numbers in the
input MDV files must match the ones specified by the user. If they
do not, the program exits. A warning is printed in this case regardless
of the value of FieldNumbersMustMatch.
</P>

<P>
FieldNumbersMustMatch should probably be FALSE in the field, since
this allows the field numbers to change if another interest field is
added to cronus. For post-processing purposes it should be TRUE.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> ForecastFieldNum </B> </P>

<P>
Forecast field number. See FieldNumbersMustMatch
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> ForecastFieldName </B> </P>

<P>

<P> <B> TruthFieldNum </B> </P> 

<P>
Truth field number. See FieldNumbersMustMatch
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> TruthFieldName </B> </P>

<P>

<P> <B> Instance </B> </P>

<P>
Procmap instance. Used for process identification.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> Slop </B> </P>

<P>
Allowable time error between a forecast and truth file, seconds.
If no truth file is found, the forecast file
will be skipped.
</P>

<HR>


<P> <B> ForecastLead </B> </P>

<P>
Forecast lead time, seconds.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> OutputInterval </B> </P>

<P>
Statistical interval time, seconds.
Statistics are output to file for every interval
of this duration. Intervals without any forecasts
in them are skipped.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> Debug </B> </P>

<P>
Debug flag.
If set to non-zero, more verbose output is printed on standard error.
</P>

<HR>


<H1> Grid Parameters </H1>

<P>
The grid parameters specify the grid onto which both the
truth and forcast data will be remapped prior to performing
the validation. The grid must be specified - if it is
to be the same as the geometry of the data on disk, then
the print_mdv utility can be used to obtain the values
for the grid parameters.
</P>

 
<P> <B> grid_origin_lat </B> </P>

<P>
Latitude of grid origin.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> grid_origin_lon </B> </P>

<HR>

<P> <B> grid_rotation </B> </P>
<P>
Rotation (in degrees) of grid from true north.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> grid_projection </B> </P>

<P>

<P>
Change in altitude between vertical levels of the output grid.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> grid_minx </B> </P>
<P>
X at grid's lower left corner.
Units for this parameter will depend upon the output grid_projection.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> grid_miny </B> </P>
<P>
Y at grid's lower left corner.
Units for this parameter will depend upon the output grid_projection.

<HR>


<HR>

<P> <B> composite_min </B> </P>
<P>
The lower level (in units of height, not plane
number) that is to be composited in the truth field.
</P>


<HR>

<P> <B> composite_max </B> </P>
<P>
The upper level (in units of height, not plane
number) that is to be composited in the truth field.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> composite_truth </B> </P>
<P>
If composite_truth is TRUE then the truth field is composited.
Limits are set by composite_min and composite_max.
</P>

<H1> End of grid parameters. </H1>

<HR>
 
<P> <B> truth_lower_limit </B> </P>
<P>
Lower limit threshold on truth data.
A storm will be detected if data >= truth_lower_limit and data <= 
  truth_upper_limit.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> truth_upper_limit </B> </P>
<P>
Upper limit threshold on truth data.
A storm will be detected if data >= truth_lower_limit and data <= 
  truth_upper_limit.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> forecast_lower_limit </B> </P>

<P>
Lower limit threshold on forecast data.
A storm will be detected if data >= forecast_lower_limit and data <= 
  forecast_upper_limit.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> forecast_upper_limit </B> </P>
<P>
Upper limit threshold on forecast data.
A storm will be detected if data >= forecast_lower_limit and data <= 
  forecast_upper_limit.
<P>

<HR>


<P> <B> ForecastRelax </B> </P>
<P>
This sets the relaxation window size for the forecast field.
The window is always an odd number squared - 1x1 (no relaxation),
3x3, 5x5. The user specifies N, and the window is 2*N+1 x 2*N+1.
Specify 0 for no relaxation, 1 for a 3x3 window and so on.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> ForecastNumRelax </B> </P>
<P>
There are three possibilities for storm detection with the forcast field.
 <UL>
  <LI> The window is enitrely full of grid points that match the storm
       critera as set by the thresholds. In this case, a storm is
       detected.
  <LI> The window is not completely filled, but it does have at
       least <B> ForecastNumRelax </B> storm grid points. In this
       case a storm is detected in realxed mode.
  <LI> The window has fewer than <B> ForecastNumRelax </B> 
       storm grid points. In this case no storm is detected.
 </UL>
Note that if ForecastNumRelax is set 0 then a storm will always be detected
(highly erroneous). If it is set to a value higher than the number of
points in the window, then the storm must completely fill the
window to be detected (ie. no relaxed mode detections).
</P>

<P>
Typically this is set to 1. Storms detected in relaxed mode are treated
the same as storms detected by filling the window unless the
extended contingency option is used (See the ExtendedContingency
option).
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> TruthRelax </B> </P>
<P>
Similar to ForecastRelax but for the truth field.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> TruthNumRelax </B> </P>
<P>
Similar to ForecastNumRelax but for the truth field.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> ExtendedContingency </B> </P>
<P>
By default the following contingency table is used.
</P>

<P align=Center>
 <Table align=Center border>

  <TR> 
   <TH> Truth  </TH>
   <TH> No storm forecast </TH> 
   <TH> Storm forecast </TH>
  </TR>

  <TR> 
   <TD> No storm eventuated  </TD>
   <TH> Non-Event </TH> 
   <TH> False alarm </TH>
  </TR>



  <TR> 
   <TD> Storm eventuated </TD>
   <TH> Failure </TH> 
   <TH> Success </TH>
  </TR>

 </Table>
</P>

<P>
Storms detected in the relaxed region are treated simply as storms
for the default contingency table. This increases the success rate but failures and
false alarms are also increased.
</P>


<P>
The extended contingency table is used if ExtendedContingency is TRUE.
It is as follows.
</P>

<P align=Center>
 <Table align=Center border>

  <TR> 
   <TH> Truth  </TH>
   <TH> No storm forecast </TH> 
   <TH> Storm forecast in relaxed mode </TH> 
   <TH> Storm forecast </TH>
  </TR>

  <TR> 
   <TD> No storm eventuated  </TD>
   <TH> Non-Event </TH> 
   <TH> Non-Event </TH> 
   <TH> False alarm </TH>
  </TR>

  <TR> 
   <TD> Storm eventuated in relaxed mode  </TD>
   <TH> Non-Event </TH> 
   <TH> Success </TH> 
   <TH> Success </TH>
  </TR>

  <TR> 
   <TD> Storm eventuated </TD>
   <TH> Failure </TH> 
   <TH> Success </TH> 
   <TH> Success </TH>
  </TR>

 </Table>
</P>

<P>
A distinction is made between storms detected and storms detected in relaxed mode
for the extended contingency table. In this case
the relaxed region increases the success rate without incurring a penalty
in false alarms or failures. This may not be considered fair.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> NotRelaxedIfTrue </B> </P>

<P>
By default, if a grid point is in a storm it may still not
be detected as such if a relaxed grid is used, since the entire
window must contain storm pixels for the grid point to be
considered a storm. In this case it is likely (but not necessarily true)
that the grid point will be detected in relaxed mode.
</P>

<P>
If NotRelaxedIfTrue is set, then if a grid point is in a storm,
then it is detected as such, rather than being detected in relaxed mode
(or a non-event).
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> CountMissing </B> </P>
<P>
Set to count missing data as being a non-event.
Do this for consistency with the old VerifyGrid program - it
may also be physically valid in the case of radar data.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> IntermediateGrids </B> </P>
<P>
If set, output intermediate MDV files.
Intermediate MDV files contain storm detected truth, storm 
detected forecast and resulting contingency table and
are useful for debugging.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> TruthComposite </B> </P>
<P>
If set, composite the truth field into 2D data.
The alternative is to compare a full 3D forecast to a full 3D truth.
<P>

<HR>

<P> <B> TruthCompositeMaxZ </B> </P>
<P>
Upper limit on compositing, if TruthComposite is TRUE.
<P>

<HR>


<P> <B> RegionSpecified </B> </P>
<P>
If set, specify a map file of the region of interest.
Default is not to do this. This allows ONE region map
to be processed - and intermediate output MDV files
can be written. Multiple regions should be processed
with the MapList parameter (which does not allow for
MDV output). Only works for FLAT projection.
</P>
<P>
This is NOT recommened - it is something of a kludge
that was perpetrated for a demo at Sterling. Regional
analyses are best done with the MapMode and MapList
parameters.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> RegionMapFile </B> </P>
<P>
Map file name for region.
Should be a polyline of lat,lon points.
See comments for RegionSpecified.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> MaxRealtimeValidAge </B> </P>
<P>
Max age (in minutes) of input data.
For realtime only - max age of input data for it to be valid.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> ClumpTruth </B> </P>
<P>
Set this to remove small clumps from the truth field.
This is often advantageous if the forecast method
is attempting to forecast large storms only, but there
are many small local storms in the truth field that
are counting against the forecast method.
</P>

<P>
If this is set, then each storm in the truth field must
be at least <B> MinTruthClumpPixels </B> grid points large,
or it is ignored.
</P>

<HR>


<P> <B> MinTruthClumpPixels </B> </P>
<P>
How small can a clump be before removal, in grid points. 
See comments for ClumpTruth.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> TemporalRelax </B> </P>
<P>
If set, composite all the truth files in the time window 
allowed by the slop parameter. If not, use only the closest
file in the window.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> MapMode </B> </P>
<P>
If set, do a regional analysis using a set of map files (specified
with the MapList parameter). If not, do the analysis over the whole
grid.
</P>

<HR>

<P> <B> MapList </B> </P>
<P>
List of map files.
Only used if MapMode is true. Map files must be
a connected polyline and have #VerifyMap as
the first line.
<P>

<P> 
An example map file may be as follows.
</P>

#VerifyMap <BR>
# <BR>
# Map of US County Prince_Georges for use with Validator <BR>
# <BR>
POLYLINE Prince_Georges 72 <BR>
38.5318 -76.6749 <BR>
38.534  -76.6799 <BR>
38.5554 -76.7361 <BR>
38.5922 -76.7486 <BR>          
</P>
<P>
38.5505 -76.6745 <BR>
38.5318 -76.6749 <BR>
-1000   -1000    <BR>
</P>

<P>
The last point is expected to be a pen-up instruction - the second to
last point is expected to be the same as the first point. The
comment #VerifyMap at the start of the file is required for
use with the Validator.
