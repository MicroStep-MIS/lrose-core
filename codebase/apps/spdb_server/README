spdb_server apps
================

The spdb_server apps include executables for serving out SPDB data 
in different ways.  Currently, the following executables exist:

spdb_server:
	The spdb_server is a generic server for serving out SPDB
	data.  When SPDB_PUT_DATA, SPDB_PUT_DATA_ADD or
	SPDB_PUT_DATA_OVER requests are received, the recieved
	data is stored in an SPDB database without any type
	of transformation.  When SDPB_GET_DATA, SPDB_GET_DATA_CLOSEST,
	SPDB_GET_DATA_INTERVAL and SPDB_GET_DATA_VALID requests
	are received, the indicated data is returned to the client,
	again without any type of transformation.  Data is assumed
	to be received and is served out in big-endian format.  This
	server has no knowledge of the structure of the data.

spdb_server_client:
	This is a menu driven test program for testing SPDB servers
	and databases.  It uses the get and put routines in the 
	symprod library (described in <symprod/spdb_client.h>) to
	store and retrieve data from any valid SPDB destination
	(currently port@host or database directory).  It currently
	knows about station report and TREC history forecast data,
	but other specific data types can be added as needed for
	testing.

spdb_server_poll:
	This is another menu driven test program for testing SPDB
	servers, but this one uses the SPDB poll routines (again
	described in <symprod/spdb_client.h>) to retrieve data.

dist_spdb_data:
	This process distributes data to other distribution processes,
	to SPDB servers or to SPDB databases.  Basically, this process
	listens on a socket for SPDB_PUT_DATA, SPDB_PUT_DATA_ADD and
	SPDB_PUT_DATA_OVER requests.  When a request is received, the
	data is sent on to all indicated destinations in the received
	format.

bdry_spdb2symprod:
ltg_spdb2symprod:
	These processes serve out data from the indicated type of SPDB
	database in SYMPROD format so that it can be displayed on the
	RAP displays through the product selector.
