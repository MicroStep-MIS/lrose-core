## Building LROSE :rose:

### Options for building LROSE

There are three ways to build LROSE:

1. Check out the source from GitHub, and use the NCAR build system.
This is recommended if you are actively involved in developing the code.
See [README_NCAR_BUILD.md](./README_NCAR_BUILD.md) for details
2. Check out the source from GitHub, and use AUTOMAKE and CONFIGURE for the build.
This is the more standard approach.
See [README_AUTOMAKE_BUILD.md](./README_AUTOMAKE_BUILD.md) for details
3. Download a pre-configured source distribution, and build from that.
See [README_DOWNLOAD_AND_BUILD.md](./README_DOWNLOAD_AND_BUILD.md) for details

### Supported operating systems

LROSE was developed and tested extensively under LINUX.

Therefore LINUX is the preferred operating system.

However, LROSE can be compiled and run under Mac OSX.

Windows is not supported.
