## Building using AUTOMAKE and CONFIGURE

### Choose your install directory (prefix)

The default is: `/usr/local/lrose`

### Check out, build and install **netcdf** support

See [README_NETCDF_BUILD.md](./README_NETCDF_BUILD.md)

### Check out LROSE

```
  git clone https://github.com/NCAR/lrose-core
```

<!---
### Install the makefile tree

The `make` application can use files named either `Makefile` or `makefile`.

The lower-case version takes preference.

The codebase contains, by default, upper-case Makefiles throughout the tree. These are **NOT** appropriate for the build.

To get the correct build, you must install the lower-case makefiles relevant to the package you want to build.

To install the makefiles for the **lrose** standard package, perform the following:

```
  cd lrose-core/codebase
  ./make_bin/install_package_makefiles.py
```
This is equivalent to the following

```
  ./make_bin/install_package_makefiles.py --package lrose
```

If you want to perform a package-specific build, you can specify that on the command line.

As an example, for the **radx** distribtion, run the following:

```
  ./make_bin/install_package_makefiles.py --package radx
```

--->

### Perform the build

To build using automake:

```
  cd lrose-core
  ./build/build_auto -p package -x prefix
```

where `prefix` is the location into which you are building.

`package` defaults to `lrose`

`prefix` defaults to `/usr/local/lrose`
