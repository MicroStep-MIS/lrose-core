## **L**:rose: - The Lidar Radar Open Software Environment

LROSE is a co-operative project between [Colorado State University (CSU)](http://www.atmos.colostate.edu/) and the [National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)](https://www.eol.ucar.edu/content/lidar-radar-open-software-environment). It is funded by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov).

### LROSE source in GitHub

This distribution contains the core software for LROSE.

To download LROSE, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/NCAR/lrose-core
```

### Building LROSE

You can build LROSE using either of the following:

  * NCAR development environment build
  * automake configure-based build
  * download pre-configured source distribution

If you are performing development, it is probably better to have the NCAR development environment.

If you just wish to use the software, the automake/configure build is preferable.

See [README_BUILD.md](./docs/README_BUILD.md) for details.
